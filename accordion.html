    There were four of us - George, and William Samuel Harris, and myself, and Montmorency.
    We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were - bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.

    We were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it. Harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness
    come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that he had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what he was doing.

    With me, it was my liver that was out of order. I knew it was my liver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which the detailed various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all.

    I tried to examine myself. I felt my pulse. I could not at first feel any pulse at all. Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off. I pulled out my watch and timed it. i made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute.

    I tried to feel my heart. I could not feel my heart. it had stopped beating. I have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time, and it must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.
